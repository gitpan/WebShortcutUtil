WebShortcutUtil
===============

Perl module for reading and writing web shortcut files.
This module is part of the WebShortcutUtil suite.  For more details
see the main website at http://beckus.github.io/WebShortcutUtil/ .

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Mac::PropertyList - Only required when reading/writing an Apple ".webloc" shortcut.

The "t/samples" folder contains samples from the following repository:
  http://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples

I chose not to use a Git submodule for this - Github does not
include the submodule when creating the downloadable tar/zip file.
If the WebShortcutSamples repository is updated, the changes
need to be manually applied in the local folder.
Sample files that contain unicode (as well as special characters)
have been omitted from the MANIFEST file.  This prevents warnings
when building on a system with limited support for unicode.
